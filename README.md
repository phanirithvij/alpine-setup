# alpine-setup
setup-alpine replacement for personal use (won't be maintained)

## Before running this

- `rmmod pcspkr` to remove the annoying bell sound
- `setup-interfaces && service networking restart && apk add git fish vim tmux`

Then run this
- `fish -C "git clone https://github.com/phanirithvij/alpine-setup && cd alpine-setup"`
- `source setup.sh`

## TODO

If doing this seriously

- [ ] get a working iso with ventoy support
- [ ] have scripts ready to go to use inside the iso, one command
